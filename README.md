## Product Vision Statement

- As a tutor, I want to create a tutor profile so that students can see what subjects I can help with.
- As a tutor, I want to see details of a tutor request so that I know the topic, time, and expectations.
- As a tutor, I want to chat with a student after accepting a request so that we can coordinate tutoring details.
